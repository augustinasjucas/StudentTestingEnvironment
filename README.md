# Testing system

## Installation
In order to install the system, first install Node.js. Then, just clone (or download) the repository. Locate the repository in your terminal and type `node server`. Then the server will start running on port `12345`. That is, the system can now be reached by typing in `localhost:12345` into the browser.
